# Reinforcement-Learning
This repo contains all projects I did for class IEOR4574 Reinforcement Leaning at Columbia University, Spring 2021. 

Prof.Shipra Agrawal 

TA: Yunhao Tang, Abhi Gupta.


## Labs
Labs are all basic implementation of different reinforctment learning methods by using existing gym environment. 

Lab1: MDP problem formulation and TD-learning method in FrozenLake-v0 environment. 

Lab2: Linear regression and classification practise. 

Lab3: DQN method in CartPole-v0 environment. 

Lab4: Policy gradient method in Cart-Pole-v0 environment. 

Details are in ```./labs```

## Project 
Project aims to use RL to solve cutting plane problem. This specific environment is created by Professor and TAs and I designed the algorithm (by referenceing paper: ) to solve this problem. Details are in ```./project ```


## Reference 

```Y. Tang, S. Agrawal, and Y. Faenza, “Reinforcement learning for integer programming: Learningto  cut,”CoRR,  vol.  abs/1906.04859,  2019. arXiv:1906.04859.  [Online].  Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04859 ```

## Disclaim

It could be the problem when directly using the code I upload here because of the environment issue or wandb license issue. The main goal for this repo is to show my work and accomplishment in this course. I'm happy to discuss with any issue and problem for any reason.
